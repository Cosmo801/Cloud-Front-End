# Cloud-Front-End

This project is sample homepage created to show my use of html, css and jQuery. It uses tools such as bootstrap and font awesome, and implements features like flexbox, bootstrap grid system and jQuery event delegation (although this isnt really doing useful work).


This page is created from the perspective of a business that offers cloud computing services for its customers.


The html page is located in the View folder.
